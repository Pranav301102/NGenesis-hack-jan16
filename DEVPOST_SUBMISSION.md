# NGenesis - AI Agent Orchestration Platform

**Tagline:** AI Agent Orchestration That Handles Complex Workflows On-Demand With Just a Prompt

---

# Inspiration

Managing multiple AI tools feels like conducting an orchestra - each API has its own documentation, authentication, and quirks. I wondered: **What if an AI agent could orchestrate everything automatically?** Just describe what you want, and let the agent figure out which tools to use, generate the necessary code, execute workflows, and ensure quality - all on-demand.

# What it does

**NGenesis is a smart AI agent that handles complex multi-tool workflows from a single prompt.**

Simply tell it what you need - like "Monitor competitor prices and create weekly reports with visuals" - and the agent:
- Analyzes your intent with **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- Generates custom code using **Cline**
- Orchestrates **TinyFish** for web scraping, **Freepik** for images, **Yutori** for monitoring
- Validates everything with **Macroscope**
- Delivers complete results

No configuration. No coding. Just intelligent, on-demand orchestration.

# How I built it

**Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript + Express with SQLite database

**Core Architecture:**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** as the orchestration brain - analyzes intents, plans workflows, synthesizes outputs
- **Cline** for on-demand code generation - creates custom execution logic for each workflow
- **AgentQL/TinyFish/Mino** for self-healing web scraping with natural language goals
- **Freepik Mystic API** for context-aware image generation
- **Yutori Scouts** for continuous website monitoring and alerts
- **Tonic Fabricate** for synthetic test data generation
- **Macroscope** for automated code quality review and validation

**Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript with a clean web dashboard for creating agents and monitoring workflows

**Key Innovation:** Multi-iteration feedback loop where Gemini evaluates outputs, identifies gaps, and triggers refinements automatically.

# Challenges I ran into

**Tool Coordination:** Getting multiple AI APIs to work together seamlessly was complex. Each tool has different authentication, response formats, and timing. Solved this by creating a unified orchestration layer with Gemini as the central coordinator.

**On-Demand Code Generation:** Making Cline generate reliable, production-ready code for unpredictable user requests required careful prompt engineering and validation loops with Macroscope.

**Quality Assurance:** Ensuring outputs from multiple tools met quality standards. Implemented a multi-iteration feedback system where Gemini scores completeness and triggers refinements when needed.

**Rate Limiting:** Managing API rate limits across multiple services while maintaining fast response times. Built intelligent throttling and parallel execution strategies.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of

✨ **True On-Demand Orchestration** - Nothing is pre-built. The agent generates custom workflows for every unique request.

🧠 **Smart Tool Selection** - Users don't specify which tools to use; Gemini analyzes intent and automatically chooses the right combination.

🔄 **Self-Validating Pipelines** - Code generated by Cline is automatically reviewed by Macroscope, ensuring quality without manual intervention.

🎯 **Real-World Impact** - Transforms complex tasks like "scrape competitors, generate reports, set up monitoring" from hours of development into a 60-second prompt.

⚡ **Intelligent Integration** - Successfully orchestrated 7 different sponsor tools into a cohesive system that's greater than the sum of its parts.

# What I learned

**AI as an Orchestrator:** Gemini isn't just good at answering questions - it excels at planning, coordinating, and synthesizing outputs from multiple sources.

**Code Generation Maturity:** Cline can generate production-quality code on-demand when properly guided, opening up possibilities for truly dynamic applications.

**Self-Healing is Powerful:** AgentQL's natural language approach to web scraping eliminates the brittleness of traditional selectors - workflows that would break with website updates just keep working.

**Quality Automation:** Macroscope's code review automation proved that quality assurance can be built into pipelines rather than being a separate manual step.

# What's next for NGenesis

**🎓 Learning from History** - Train the agent to learn from past executions, getting smarter about tool selection and workflow optimization over time.

**🎨 Custom Tool Creation** - Let users create their own tool integrations that the agent can incorporate into future workflows.

**📅 Advanced Scheduling** - Multi-step workflows with conditional logic, scheduled execution, and dependency management.

**🏢 Enterprise Features** - Team collaboration, role-based access, usage analytics, and centralized API key management.

**🌐 Template Marketplace** - Community-shared workflow templates that users can customize and deploy instantly.

**Vision:** Make NGenesis the universal orchestration layer for AI tools - where any combination of services can work together intelligently, no manual integration required.
